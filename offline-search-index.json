[{"body":"Who You Are Being informed about urbanist issues involves finding groups and sources of information that can help you find what to act on. Everyone cares about different aspects of urbanism be it housing, equity, public transit, bike lanes, safety, etc. Lean into this.\nBeing an urbanist does not require that you know and do everything. There are many of us. If we each pick and do what we’re most interested in then the overall goals of urbanism will be better for it. Doing urbanism is mostly volunteer and unpaid work so if you’re going to do it you may as well like either the work, the outcome, or both.\nWhat do urbanists do? Urbanists make their voice heard. It may sound simple or cheesy but this is what anti-urbanists do and it’s why our neighborhoods are put together so poorly and unfairly. We are going to change this.\nWe do this in a variety of ways that vary from low effort to high effort. Start where you want but we suggest starting with simple, low effort actions to dip your toes, familiarize yourself, and build from there. All of these efforts can and do have a high impact on how our cities and towns evolve.\nSimple Answering surveys Contacting representatives Moderate Attending city council meetings Canvassing / door knocking, \u0026 phone banking Attending demonstrations and protests Urbanist content creation High Event planning Organizing TODO Getting Informed There are many places to get informed on Austin urbanism and find many things to do.

Learn more about getting around today and what’s coming.\nBiking in Austin is becoming more and more accessible with over 230 miles already built. With every bike lane added, with every person out riding bikes, drivers and people in general become more familiar with, aware of, and supportive of biking as a form of commute.\nBiking is not just healthy but also offere many other benefits:\nIt’s much cheaper than driving. Even an e-bike uses just 5-10 cents of electricity per charge and a typical e-bike has a range of 30-60 miles. It’s significantly less strain on infrastructure. Bikes cause almost zero damage to roads. Larger, heavier vehicles are responsible for road damage. Biking is generally a much more pleasant experience than driving. You feel a lot more present, more attached to the world around you, people wave and smile, and you simply move around at more human and lower stressed speeds. Getting Around Biking in Austin is becoming more and more accessible with over 230 miles already built. With every bike lane we add we get more and more people out enjoying a simply more pleasant way of commuting.\nIt’s also important to note that not every commute is fit for biking and keeping your safety and comfort in mind is always the most important thing. Manual biking is most suitable to trips of 3 miles or less which fortunately makes up about half of all trips within Austin. With e-bikes this range is extended considerably.\nTODO: Find the source on the 3 mile stat.\nSo if you want to start biking check out the links below to find a bike, or start planning routes and finding things that are reasonable and comfortable for you to reach.\nAAA Bike Network The city of Austin has planned out an All Ages and Abilities network with the goal of creating over 800 miles of bike lanes across Austin. You can find plans, analysis, and maps of the city’s biking network within their AAA biking network tool here. It’s a great place to get started with seeing what bike lanes are near you.\nScroll through to find regularly updated maps of what’s been finished, what’s currently being built, and what’s coming! This tool also contains a list of each project, its status, and it’s style (known as a treatment type). Style varies from painted bike lanes to fully protected and separated lanes. You can view this info in table format or by clicking on a particular segment on the buildout map.\nAustin 2023 Bicycle Plan Austin recently updated its AAA network plan to make cycling an integral part of the city’s transportation network. The biggest improvements over the 2014 plan are a number of new street identified for the AAA network and a commitment to concrete barrier or planter protection for all protected bike lanes when the network reaches full build-out. You can read the full updated AAA 2023 Bicycle Plan here.\nBiking Route Applications The biggest and most popular mapping apps unfortunately don’t always do the best job giving you the best biking routes. They’re still very car-focused and as such tend to not consider the various side streets, short cuts, and slightly longer but safer routes that most bike riders prefer. Fortunately there are many apps available to help you plan your routes such as:\nTODO\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Choosing to do some of your trips by bike is a great way to contribute …","ref":"/austin/transportation/biking/","tags":"","title":"Biking"},{"body":"","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"","ref":"/categories/","tags":"","title":"Categories"},{"body":"Compatibility is a way for owners of single family homes to control what others do with their homes. It’s implemented as a second set of building restrictions beyond city zoning.\nIn Austin Austin has some of the most restrictive compatibility requirements within the United States. Austin’s current compatibility restrictions are such that:\nA building within 50 feet of a SFH’s lot cannot be more than 40 feet tall. A building within 300 feet of a SFH’s lot cannot be more than 60 feet tall. Source: Findings and Recommendations for Implementing Ordinance No. 20221201-056 Regarding Compatibility Regulations, Sept 5 2023\nEffectively this means that tens of thousands of homes are currently illegal to build in Austin even in areas that are zoned for slightly denser housing. If you’ve ever noticed buildings within Austin that look like steps, getting progressively taller/shorter, this is compatibility. An artificial, and inequitable restriction on the amount of housing that can be built.\nAustin compatibility is also atypically extreme compared to most other cities. As shown in this chart where Austin has decided that the presence of a single family home can affect housing that is being built 2 blocks away.\nSource: Findings and Recommendations for Implementing Ordinance No. 20221201-056 Regarding Compatibility Regulations, Sept 5 2023\nKnock-on Effects The failure of compatibility does not stop at simply housing. It also has effects on transportation, equity, the environment, and car dependency. A recent study by the City of Austin on Compatibility Regulations (September, 2023) found that 82% of housing that is lost is within walking distance of an existing transit stop.\nCompatibility triggers even when no homes exist on a lot. It requires that if an area is zoned for single family housing then that is enough to restrict what can be built by it. In this way almost completely empty pieces of land, such as the one pictured below, limit what housing can be built around it.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Compatibility is a way for owners of single family homes to control …","ref":"/austin/housing/compatibility_restrictions/","tags":"","title":"Compatibility Restrictions"},{"body":"TODO\n","categories":"","description":"Deed restrictions are agreements between large groups of homeowners that have historically been used for excluding people and homes from neighborhoods\n","excerpt":"Deed restrictions are agreements between large groups of homeowners …","ref":"/austin/housing/deed_restrictions/","tags":"","title":"Deed Restrictions"},{"body":"BRT / Bus rapid transit:\nLRT:\nSFH / Single Family Home:\nTOD / Transit Oriented Development:\nETOD / Equitable TOD:\nROW / Right of way: Refers to land that is owned by a department, city, or other entity that can be used for transportation.\n","categories":"","description":"Common urbanist terminology and abbreviations.\n","excerpt":"Common urbanist terminology and abbreviations.\n","ref":"/appendix/glossary/","tags":"","title":"Glossary"},{"body":"TxDOT, CAMPO, and the TTC are the three organizations and political bodies that are responsible for our mess of deadly highways. TTC is a state-wide body of 5 political appointees that plans and authorizes 10 year transportation plans (aka UTPs) at a state level. These plans then get passed to TxDOT who must work with CAMPO to identify projects, funding, and finally approve plans that achieve the goals of the UTP.\nTexas Department of Transportation (TxDOT) The Texas Department of Transportation is the state’s department that plans and implements roads for cars and trucks on ROWs that they own or have access to use. In principal a Department Of Transportation should create transportation options for all modes of transportation. However in practice and in law they spend almost all of their funding on road expansions.\nTxDOT road expansions include highways as well as many regular streets within cities and towns that they also own. This means that in some cases urbanist efforts to improve certain roads are frustrated by the state’s desire to harm its people over petty grievances. Due to this fatal crashes on state owned roadways continue to rise, while on non-state roads fatalities have remained flat.\nSource: Austin Vision Zero Update, May 25 2023\nTxDOT Funding Proposition 1: Directs 37.5% of existing oil and natural gas production taxes (aka severance) to TxDOT so that “the funds may only be used for constructing, maintaining, and acquiring rights-of-way for public roadways other than toll roads.”\nProposition 7: Directs portions of state sales and use taxes, as well as motor vehicle sale and rental taxes to: “(1) construct, maintain, or acquire rights of way for public roadways other than toll roads; or (2) repay the principal of and interest on general obligation bonds issued as authorized by Section 49-p, Article III, of this constitution.”\nIn combination these propositions have lead to tens of billions of state tax dollars being directed towards maintaining and expanding highways and all the negativies that car dependent infrastructure brings to us and our cities.\nTODO: Explain where this money was taken away from\nCapital Metropolitan Transportation Authority (CAMPO) The Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization is a 22-member board that makes transportation policy decisions. This board contains 4 members from Austin which means that Austin’s overall voting and decision making power is significantly lower than its population. This leads to poor decision making that negatively impacts Austin because our needs are not adequately represented.\nCAMPO Funding TODO\nTexas Transportation Commission (TTC) The final piece to the puzzle of how transportation gets built in is the TTC.

This guide seeks to be a resource for those …","ref":"/","tags":"","title":"Welcome"},{"body":"\nHousing Reform Most zoning and other home building regulations in the United States are highly restrictive. These laws largely make it illegal to build anything other than single family homes in most areas of most of the US and intentionally relegate more affordable styles of housing to far away areas and beside noisy highways with poor air quality and little options to go outside.\nUrbanists seek to reform these laws so that more varied types of housing can be built in more locations. While results will vary depending on the type of reform, in general these types of reforms can result in more affordable housing, walkable and friendly neighborhoods, and more diversity of income within a single neighborhood.\nBig picture these reforms seek to make a neighborhood more like a neighborhood and less like a series of large expensive pods where neighbors can’t easily interact.\nTo put it another way, these reforms seek to be big tent where if someone wants to live in a single family house they certainly can but they do not get to say that their neighborhood should exclude young adults, service workers, or first responders on the basis of income.\nToday many cottages, townhouses, apartment buildings, condos, and other housing get relegated to specially designated areas. Any amenities they have, such as a park, or local walkable grocery, are cut off by distance and roads from the rest of the town or city.\nHousing reform is all about sharing a vibrant neighborhood with your neighbors rather than cutting out your own tiny and uninteresting sliver.\nGood Transportation Urbanism takes the realistic stance that a car dependent society has been a significant failure in many aspects of life, from smog and health, to loneliness and isolation, to thousands of hours wasted in traffic, to 40,000 yearly traffic fatalities and 2,500,000 injuries. Someone you know, care about, or love will be seriously injured or killed on a road at some point in your life. It is a statistical inevitability. Many times when this happens we will blame the driver, or call it an “accident” but the true cause of this unnecessary suffering is undoubtedly car dependence.\nWhile cars are still necessary urbanism seeks to reform our car dependent society and shift to multimodal transportation which reduces our need for cars. This includes making space and improvements for bus lanes, bike lanes, trains, walking, and hoverboards once science catches up. Many of our towns and cities today are hostile to non-car transportation. Lacking shade, sidewalks, and safe street crossings they are wholly unfit for most people most of the time.\nUrbanism also seeks to make things safer and faster for cars, manual laborers, and emergency vehicles. By getting drivers off the road when they don’t need to be our roads become less occupied with cars and reduce traffic. With less cars on the road maintenance is also reduced and the occurrence of potholes and need to repave roads becomes less frequent.\nMuch like housing, the urbanist approach to road safety is also big tent. Some people will need to use roads for their job or for particularly remote travel or just because they like driving on open roads every so often. That’s perfectly fine but we must make our roads less crowded and safer.\nHuman Scale Neighborhoods Most US neighborhoods are built at car scale rather than human scale. They prioritize placing housing separate from spaces such as parks, groceries, restaurants, and all other types of places where people like to gather. They create long travel distances for the types of things that replenish everything from your fridge to your soul.\nHuman scale neighborhoods seek to bring these necessities of life closer to where people live. Allowing people to easily bump into their neighbors. To get that missing ingredient they need for tonight’s dinner. Or hop on a bus to and from a restaurant without worrying about parking, expensive taxis. Closer amenities make our roads less busy, reduce our climate impact, and drop drunk driving rates.\nFairness Our cities unfortunately have a history of unfair treatment depending on who you are and where you live. These issues are many and vast, some of the most salient of which are:\nRedlining: The wholesale exclusion of racial and ethnic minority neighborhoods from financial services such as home loans. Segregation by design: How local governments through policy and actions forced our cities and neighborhoods to be segregated. Such as the destruction of Black American and immigrant neighborhoods to build highways as physical barriers separating former neighbors. The habit of wealthy neighbors to advocate for moving whatever they don’t want to less fortunate neighborhoods. Urbanists seek to address these issues by supporting laws, projects, and protests that address a wide variety of equity concerns.\n","categories":"","description":"Urbanists want housing reform, good transportation, human scale neighborhoods, and fairness for all of their city's residents.\n","excerpt":"Urbanists want housing reform, good transportation, human scale …","ref":"/getting_started/what_urbanists_want/","tags":"","title":""}]
