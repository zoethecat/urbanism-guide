&lt;p>Choosing to do some of your trips by bike is a great way to contribute to urbanism in Austin. Learn more about getting around today and what&amp;rsquo;s coming.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Biking in Austin is becoming more and more accessible with over 230 miles already built. With every bike lane added, with every person out riding bikes, drivers and people in general become more familiar with, aware of, and supportive of biking as a form of commute.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Biking is not just healthy but also offere many other benefits:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s much cheaper than driving. Even an e-bike uses just 5-10 cents of electricity per charge and a typical e-bike has a range of 30-60 miles.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>It&amp;rsquo;s significantly less strain on infrastructure. Bikes cause almost zero damage to roads. Larger, heavier vehicles &lt;a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_power_law">are responsible for road damage&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Biking is generally a much more pleasant experience than driving. You feel a lot more present, more attached to the world around you, people wave and smile, and you simply move around at more human and lower stressed speeds.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;p>Biking in Austin is becoming more and more accessible with over 230 miles already built. With every bike lane we add we get more and more people out enjoying a simply more pleasant way of commuting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s also important to note that not every commute is fit for biking and keeping your safety and comfort in mind is always the most important thing. Manual biking is most suitable to trips of 3 miles or less which fortunately makes up about half of all trips within Austin. With e-bikes this range is extended considerably.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>TODO: Find the source on the 3 mile stat.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So if you want to start biking check out the links below to find a bike, or start planning routes and finding things that are reasonable and comfortable for you to reach.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="aaa-bike-network">AAA Bike Network&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The city of Austin has planned out an All Ages and Abilities network with the goal of creating over 800 miles of bike lanes across Austin. You can find plans, analysis, and maps of the city&amp;rsquo;s biking network within their &lt;a href="https://austin.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapJournal/index.html?appid=dba125033d42453491b36ea5fb935eea">AAA biking network tool here&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s a great place to get started with seeing what bike lanes are near you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Scroll through to find regularly updated maps of what&amp;rsquo;s been finished, what&amp;rsquo;s currently being built, and what&amp;rsquo;s coming! This tool also contains a list of each project, its status, and it&amp;rsquo;s style (known as a treatment type). Style varies from painted bike lanes to fully protected and separated lanes. You can view this info in table format or by clicking on a particular segment on the buildout map.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="austin-2023-bicycle-plan">Austin 2023 Bicycle Plan&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Austin recently updated its AAA network plan to make cycling an integral part of the city&amp;rsquo;s transportation network. The biggest improvements over the 2014 plan are a number of new street identified for the AAA network and a commitment to concrete barrier or planter protection for all protected bike lanes when the network reaches full build-out. You can read the full &lt;a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/link/track?uri=urn%3Aaaid%3Ascds%3AUS%3Aab8e2bdd-f183-3e4d-bbc1-187138049fba">updated AAA 2023 Bicycle Plan here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="biking-route-applications">Biking Route Applications&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The biggest and most popular mapping apps unfortunately don&amp;rsquo;t always do the best job giving you the best biking routes. They&amp;rsquo;re still very car-focused and as such tend to not consider the various side streets, short cuts, and slightly longer but safer routes that most bike riders prefer. Fortunately there are many apps available to help you plan your routes such as:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>TxDOT, CAMPO, and the TTC are the three organizations and political bodies that are responsible for our mess of deadly highways. TTC is a state-wide body of 5 political appointees that plans and authorizes 10 year transportation plans (aka UTPs) at a state level. These plans then get passed to TxDOT who must work with CAMPO to identify projects, funding, and finally approve plans that achieve the goals of the UTP.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="texas-department-of-transportation-txdot">Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Texas Department of Transportation is the state&amp;rsquo;s department that plans and implements roads for cars and trucks on ROWs that they own or have access to use. In principal a Department Of Transportation &lt;em>should&lt;/em> create transportation options for all modes of transportation. However in practice and &lt;a href="">in law&lt;/a> they spend almost all of their funding on road expansions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TxDOT road expansions include highways as well as many regular streets within cities and towns that they also own. This means that in some cases urbanist efforts to improve certain roads are frustrated by the state&amp;rsquo;s desire to harm its people over petty grievances. Due to this fatal crashes on state owned roadways continue to rise, while on non-state roads fatalities have remained flat.&lt;/p>

&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CN/htm/CN.3/CN.3.49-g.v2.htm">Proposition 1&lt;/a>: Directs 37.5% of existing oil and natural gas production taxes (aka severance) to TxDOT so that &amp;ldquo;the funds may only be used for constructing, maintaining, and acquiring rights-of-way for public roadways other than toll roads.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/CN/htm/CN.8/CN.8.7-c.htm">Proposition 7&lt;/a>: Directs portions of state sales and use taxes, as well as motor vehicle sale and rental taxes to: &amp;ldquo;(1) construct, maintain, or acquire rights of way for public roadways other than toll roads; or (2) repay the principal of and interest on general obligation bonds issued as authorized by Section 49-p, Article III, of this constitution.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In combination these propositions have lead to tens of billions of state tax dollars being directed towards maintaining and expanding highways and all the negativies that car dependent infrastructure brings to us and our cities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>TODO: Explain where this money was taken away from&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="capital-metropolitan-transportation-authority-campo">Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority (CAMPO)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The Capital Area Metropolitan Planning Organization is a 22-member board that makes transportation policy decisions. This board contains 4 members from Austin which means that Austin&amp;rsquo;s overall voting and decision making power is significantly lower than its population. This leads to poor decision making that negatively impacts Austin because our needs are not adequately represented.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="texas-transportation-commission-ttc">Texas Transportation Commission (TTC)&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The final piece to the puzzle of how transportation gets built in is the TTC. They are a small body of 5 political appointees that make 10 year plans for CAMPO and TxDOT to fund and implement.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Austin: Project Connect</title><link>https://example.org/austin/transportation/project_connect/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.org/austin/transportation/project_connect/</guid><description>

&lt;p>Vision zero is a multifaceted strategy that is being used across the world to reduce traffic related injuries and fatalities down to zero.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At a broad level vision zero incorporates:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Safer street design&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Evidence-based policy&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Public engagement&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Targeted law enforcement&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>While Vision Zero is primarily policy and research much of what is actually implemented is done via the &lt;a href="https://www.austintexas.gov/department/austin-strategic-mobility-plan">Austin Strategic Mobility Plan&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
